- aae.py: builds the ML framework and contains functions to train and test it
- data_reader.py: reads the data for training/testing the ML framework
- main.py: contains modifiable parameters for training/testing the ML framework
- ops.py: contains the architecture of the ML framework

This code was adapted from the cGAN developed in the paper "Computational Modeling of Cellular Structures Using Conditional Deep Generative Networks". The original code is available at: https://github.com/divelab/cgan
