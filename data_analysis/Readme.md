- 3D_cell_eval: notebook containing code to analyze results from ML training. It computes the prediction accuracy for nucleus using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and prediction accuracy for FA sites using Discrete Protein Metric (DPM). It also calculates the Global prediction accuracy score and FA-Nucleus Distribution (FA-ND) score. Furthermore, the code uses the processed nucleus and FA sites to build a 3D representation of the True Cell (ground truth) and Digital Twin (prediction) that can be then visualized using AGAVE (see digital_twin folder).
