This folder contains the codes for data processing prior to input into the ML framework for training/testing.
- data_augmentation: This notebook contains the code to augment the dataset contained in train_set.zip for training of ML framework. 
- data_conversion: This notebook contains the code to convert the z-stacks to HDF5 format. The code can be altered to convert the FA and nucleus datasets by changing the data_folder variable and altering the channels to be used for reference R array (red and green if training for nucleus, red and blue if training for FA). WARNING: The code requires ~200GB memory due to large size of dataset.
